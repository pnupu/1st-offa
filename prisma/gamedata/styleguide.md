### **PowerPoint Style Guide for Presentation**

#### **1. Slide Layouts & Structure**
- **Title Slide**:  
   - Use a large, bold font for the project title (e.g., Arial or Helvetica, 44pt).
   - Include the project code and brief tagline under the title in a smaller font (e.g., 20pt).
   - Place the company logo and date in the bottom-right corner for consistency.

- **Content Slides**:
   - **Title**: Bold and clear, Arial or Helvetica, 36pt.
   - **Body**: Use bullet points, 24pt font size.
   - Keep text aligned left or center depending on the visual hierarchy.
   - **Images/Graphics**: Align images to the right or left with a maximum width of 50% of the slide. Make sure there is a small padding around images for clarity.

- **Section Break Slide**:
   - Large text in bold, 36pt, with the section name.
   - Minimalist design, focus on clarity and simplicity.

#### **2. Color Scheme**
- **Primary Colors**:
   - **Dark Blue**: #003366 (for text, headings, and key accents).
   - **White**: #FFFFFF (for backgrounds and slide text).
   - **Gray**: #B0B0B0 (for secondary text and borders).
   
- **Accent Colors**:
   - **Light Blue**: #66B2FF (for highlighting important points).
   - **Orange**: #FF7F32 (for callouts and key statistics).
   
- **Background**:
   - **Light Gray** (#F4F4F4) for content slides.
   - **White** for section headers.

#### **3. Fonts**
- **Headings**: Use bold sans-serif fonts like Arial, Helvetica, or Open Sans.
  - Size: 36pt for slide titles, 28pt for section titles.
  
- **Body Text**: Arial, Calibri, or Open Sans, regular weight.
  - Size: 24pt for most body text.
  - Ensure the line spacing is set to 1.5 for better readability.

#### **4. Visual Elements**
- **Charts & Graphs**:
  - Use simple bar, line, or pie charts.
  - Keep color coding consistent with the color scheme (e.g., dark blue for main data, light blue for accents).
  - Ensure all chart text (labels, legends) is readable and not cluttered.

- **Icons & Images**:
  - Use flat design icons in a consistent color (e.g., light blue, orange).
  - Place high-resolution images (avoid pixelation) with a clear visual relationship to the slide content.
  
- **Infographics**: Keep it simple and direct. Use arrows, circular diagrams, and timeline graphics with light background colors.

#### **5. Animation & Transitions**
- **Slide Transitions**:
   - Use subtle transitions like "Fade" for smoothness.
   - Avoid heavy transitions like "Push" or "Zoom" as they can be distracting.

- **Animations**:
   - Use simple animations such as "Appear" or "Fade In" for bullet points.
   - Limit the use of animations to important information to maintain professionalism.

#### **6. Data Presentation Tips**
- **Consistency**: Always follow the same layout for similar data across slides to provide a sense of uniformity.
- **Clarity**: Use easy-to-read charts with clear labels and axis markers. Avoid excessive jargon in data descriptions.

#### **7. Final Touches**
- **Branding**: Ensure the company logo is present in the footer of each slide (size should not overpower the content).
- **Margins**: Always leave adequate margins around the content to avoid text or images feeling cramped.

- **Final Review**: Before presenting, ensure there are no spelling mistakes and all slides maintain consistency in font sizes, colors, and layout.
