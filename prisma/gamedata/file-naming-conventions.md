# File Naming and Organization Standards

**Purpose:** To create a streamlined and consistent structure for project file storage, ensuring all team members can easily locate documents, track progress, and archive completed work.

## 1. Naming Conventions

### Projects
Each project folder should begin with a unique project code, followed by the quarter/year, and finally the document’s content type.  
**Format:** `ProjectCode_YearQuarter_ContentType`  
**Example:** `PRJ5678_2023Q4_Report`

### Dates
For documents requiring specific dates (such as meeting minutes or milestone updates), append the date in `YYYYMMDD` format at the end of the file name.  
**Example:** `PRJ5678_2023Q4_MeetingMinutes_20231015`

### Project Phases
Within each project folder, organize files by the specific project phase. Common phases include:
- `Phase1_Research`
- `Phase2_Design`
- `Phase3_Implementation`
- `Phase4_Evaluation`

This helps to keep a clear workflow and allows team members to understand the project’s current phase at a glance.

### Document Type Tags
Include a tag indicating the type of document, such as:
- `Report`, `Presentation`, `Invoice`, `Budget`, `Notes`, `Timeline`  
**Example:** `PRJ5678_2023Q4_Presentation`
